Graph coloring is an interesting topic in graph theory. It can be vertex coloring, edge coloring or face coloring. The number of colors that we use to color the graph is important. Our program visualizes the Vizing's theorem indicating the number of colors for edge coloring of a valid graph. Here, a valid graph does not have to eject the same color of incident edges of a vertex.
